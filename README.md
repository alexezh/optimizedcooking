Welcome to Optimized Cooking, a curated collection of recipes designed to deliver high-quality results with minimal effort.

As generative AI has proliferated, finding a straightforward recipe online has become increasingly challenging. Popular cooking websites are cluttered with ads, lengthy personal stories, and pages of redundant instructions, only to often present a recipe that is nearly identical to countless others.

The aim of the Optimized Cooking project is to provide a diverse selection of simple, efficient recipes, offering variety without the hassle.

The recipes organized in two ways

* [By kind of meal](https://github.com/alexezh/optimizedcooking/wiki/By-kind-of-meal) 
* [By cooking process](https://github.com/alexezh/optimizedcooking/wiki/By-cooking-process)
