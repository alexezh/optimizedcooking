Examples: goulash, beef bourguignon,

The basic idea is to cook meat for 2-3 hours to make it soft. The result depends on the type of meat and amount of fat and fluid. My favorite kind of meat so far is beef chuck and it can be cooked with very little additional water.

The basic of the recepie:
- Cut meat into 1in (2-3 sm) cubes
- Pour 
- Add optional ingridients
- Add spices
- Cook for 2-3 hours

Lately I prefer to keep lead slighlty opened to allow water to escape. In 1.5 hours, the water is reduced by 2-3 cups so you have to be careful. Also, if water does not cover meat, it is useful to steer every half an our so all meat is consistent

Optional components
- Onion - either yeallow or shallots or mix
-- adds lots of liquid, might need to adjust the overall amount of water
- Mushrooms
- Zuccini, pepers
- better to add 30 min before completion, otherwise too mushy
